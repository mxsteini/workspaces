## Introduction
Workspaces lets you configure and quickly launch all you need to work on a project. It can open in a second different instances of code, a specific website and a directory.

## Motivation
I normally work on different projects throught the day, and some of them require a lot of apps to have open, they have different urls etc.

With Workspaces I'm able with a click to open all the stuff I need for a project. I can also check links for github, isues etc for the projects.

I used to use the [Workspaces](https://www.apptorium.com/workspaces) app for mac and I made it very similar.
